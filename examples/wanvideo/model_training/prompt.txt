Static, orthographic 2D shot; keep the framing, positions, and identities exactly as in the image. Pure white background, no extra elements. Any black rods remain fixed and immovable as obstacles. Red circles and gray rods are dynamic rigid bodies. Uniform downward gravity with no air resistance. Objects never interpenetrate; on contact they bounce and spin with elastic rigid-body collisions, conserving linear and angular momentum. Screen borders act as rigid walls. The camera is completely staticâ€”no pan, no zoom, no shake. Minimalist 2D schematic look: flat colors, crisp vector edges, no shading, no shadows, no textures, no motion blur.
